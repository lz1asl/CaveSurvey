<p><i>CaveSurvey</i> tries to make creating speleo maps easier by aiding the data collection. It allows you to take the measurements table with you underground and leverages all the sensors available to facilitate the surveying process. Measurements can be typed manually, read via Bluetooth (check the supported laser distance measurer devices) or with the built-in compass/clinometer. You can enter notes, save the GPS location at the entrances, take pictures, draw simple sketches etc. Data collected can be verified on site with simple 2D map and exported in Excel, AutoCAD, Therion, Google Earth and others for further processing.</p>
